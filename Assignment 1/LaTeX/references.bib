	abstract = {{UMAP} (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. {UMAP} is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The {UMAP} algorithm is competitive with t-{SNE} for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, {UMAP} has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},
