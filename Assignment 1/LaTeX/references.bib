	shorttitle = {{UMAP}},
	abstract = {{UMAP} (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. {UMAP} is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The {UMAP} algorithm is competitive with t-{SNE} for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, {UMAP} has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

	title = {Modern hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2378},
	abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering which perform most efficiently in the general-purpose setup that is given in modern standard software. Requirements are: (1) the input data is given by pairwise dissimilarities between data points, but extensions to vector data are also discussed (2) the output is a "stepwise dendrogram", a data structure which is shared by all implementations in current standard software. We present algorithms (old and new) which perform clustering in this setting efficiently, both in an asymptotic worst-case analysis and from a practical point of view. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a new algorithm which is suitable for any distance update scheme and performs significantly better than the existing algorithms. (2) We prove the correctness of two algorithms by Rohlf and Murtagh, which is necessary in each case for different reasons. (3) We give well-founded recommendations for the best current algorithms for the various agglomerative clustering schemes.},
